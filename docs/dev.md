# Development

Some notes on the development practices of this release.


## Branches

The following core branches are used...

 * `master` - official release and recommended production usage
 * `release-*` - maintenance release branches (typically only used for priority, security-related patches)
 * `gh-pages` - statically generated documentation (autogenerated)


## Tags

Tags are used to record the state at a particular version.

 * since 4.0, tags refer to the commit from which a BOSH release was created and are annotated
 * earlier, tags refer to the commit where a BOSH release was finalized
